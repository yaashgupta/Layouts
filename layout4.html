        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Bootstrap is the most popular CSS Framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.

            Bootstrap 5 is the newest version of Bootstrap</p>
            <p>Bootstrap is a free, open source front-end development framework for the creation of websites and web apps. Designed to enable responsive development of mobile-first websites, Bootstrap provides a collection of syntax for template designs.

                As a framework, Bootstrap includes the basics for responsive web development, so developers only need to insert the code into a pre-defined grid system. The Bootstrap framework is built on Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), cascading style sheets (CSS) and JavaScript. Web developers using Bootstrap can build websites much faster without spending time worrying about basic commands and functions.</p>

        <h2>What is Bootstrap Used for</h2>
        <p>Bootstrap makes responsive web design a reality. It makes it possible for a web page or app to detect the visitor's screen size and orientation and automatically adapt the display accordingly. The mobile-first approach assumes smartphones, tablets and task-specific mobile apps are employees' primary tools for getting work done. Bootstrap addresses the requirements of those technologies in design and includes UI components, layouts, JavaScript tools and the implementation framework. The software is available precompiled or as source code.</p>
        <p>Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton developed Bootstrap at Twitter to improve the consistency of tools used on the site and to reduce maintenance. The software was formerly known as Twitter Blueprint and is sometimes referred to as Twitter Bootstrap.</p>

        <h3>Bootstrap in a Computer</h3>

        <h3>Bootstrapping in Statistics</h3>
        <p>In statistics, bootstrapping describes the process of resampling a data set to create many</p>
        <p>simulated samples. This approach enables users to calculate standard errors, perform</p>
        <p>hypothesis testing and construct confidence intervals for different types of sample statistics.</p>

        <h3>Bootstrapping in general terms</h3>
        <p>In the physical world, a bootstrap is a small strap or loop at the back of a leather boot that enables the boot to be pulled on. In general use, bootstrapping is leveraging a small initial effort into something larger and more significant. The metaphor, "pulling yourself up by your bootstraps," means to achieve success from a small beginning.</p>
